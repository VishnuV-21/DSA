SinglyLinked list code can be derived from chatgpt. 

As of now i know how to create a single linked list. 
And also to understand by looking at the code.

	search an element in the list
	reverse the list 
	find nth node from the end of te list 
	remove duplicate from the sorted singly linked list 
	insert a node in the sorted singly linked list 
	remove a key from the singly linked list 
	detect a loop in the singly linked list 
	find the start for a loop in a singly linked list 
	remove loop from a singly linked list
